# How to Use
Basically, follow the prompt.

When the program begins, it will tell you to input a file name. This is used to store your word list data.
If you don't enter anything, the program will create a file named "file.txt" for you. 
You can also enter a name that is not occupied within the same folder as the script to personalize the name of your word list.

If you have an existing word list, enter its name to import it. It should be formatted according to a standard.
